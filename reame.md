The official website of MOGMAXIMUS (**$MOMA**) on Solana.

**"Pablo Picasso said: 'Bad artists copy. Good artists steal."**

The essence of this quote is about understanding how to take the best ideas from those who came
before-not by imitating the masters point by point, but by transforming your own art into something new.
**There is no such thing as 'original' without drawing inspiration from others.**

_We are all a collection of life experiences, shaped as part of a society._

**Art should be free and accessible to everyone.** So, if this website or the entire project inspires you to
create something great and new, **feel free to take inspiration or steal from MOG MAXIMUS**.
